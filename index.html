        <div class="location-date"><strong>MADISON, WI</strong> — Madison residents are in shock after news broke that Evan Sage, a second-year PhD student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, was allegedly involved in an armed robbery on Wednesday night. The incident occurred at Green Leaf Market on Regent Street, just blocks from the university’s main campus.</div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>According to police reports, Sage entered the store around 9:15 PM, brandished a firearm, and demanded cash from the register. Witnesses described the robbery as “quick but tense,” and the cashier recounted Sage’s calm but assertive tone as he instructed them to hand over all available cash.</p>
            <p>Security footage from the store captured images of the suspect, leading police to identify him as Sage. “We were able to use fingerprints from the scene and other evidence to make a positive identification,” Detective Carlson from the Madison Police Department stated.</p>
            <p>Sage, who was known to be studying safe AI technologies, was reportedly last seen heading northbound from the market. His acquaintances expressed disbelief, stating that Sage has always been “dedicated to his research and was a quiet, focused individual.”</p>
            <p>Madison Police have issued an arrest warrant as the investigation continues.</p>
